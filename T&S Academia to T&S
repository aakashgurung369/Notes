Transitioning to Trust & Safety from Academia:

Circuitous Routes are Common: There isn't a single, linear path into Trust and Safety. Many professionals, like the panelists, find themselves in the field through unexpected opportunities or by applying their academic skills to real-world problems.
The Value of Internships: Internships, especially at large tech companies, are highlighted as "mind-blowing" and transformative experiences. They offer a crucial bridge between theoretical knowledge and the practicalities of Trust and Safety at scale. While competitive and often reserved for PhD students, they can fundamentally change a person's research approach and career trajectory.
High Demand for Trust & Safety Professionals: Lindsay notes that "Trust and Safety teams are generally desperate for staffing." This is due to burnout and the unique challenges of the work, leading to constant openings. This suggests a relatively accessible job market for those with relevant interests and skills.
Diverse Backgrounds are Valued: The panel emphasizes that a degree in Information Science or a specific tech background is "absolutely not the only pathway." Trust and Safety teams actively seek individuals from a wide range of disciplines, including:
Law
Public Policy
Psychology
Anthropology
Computer Science (as demonstrated by Aaron's background)
Marketing (as demonstrated by Lindsay's prior career)
Focus on Skills, Not Just Topics: Aaron highlights that for larger companies, the focus in hiring often extends beyond specific topic areas to the transferable skills an applicant possesses. This includes research methodology, data analysis (quantitative and qualitative), project management, and communication.
Gaining Experience is Key: Trust and Safety often requires a higher level of experience. This experience can be gained through:
Academic Research: Conducting relevant research projects during undergraduate or graduate studies.
Online Community Moderation: Actively participating in and moderating online communities, especially at scale, provides hands-on experience with real-world trust and safety issues.
Contracting and Advisory Roles: For those leaving academia, taking on part-time contracting projects with research, policy, or operations teams at companies can be a great way to "test the waters" and gain a "foot in the door."
Non-Profit Organizations: Many smaller non-profit organizations are active in content moderation and trust and safety, offering alternative avenues to gain experience.
Internal Transfers within Companies: Lindsay advises that once inside a company, it's often easier to transition into other roles, including Trust and Safety teams. This suggests that getting any foot in the door at a tech company can be a viable strategy.
Understanding the "Pillars" of Trust & Safety: Cat and Lindsay recommend familiarizing oneself with the basic functions within Trust and Safety, such as:
Policy Teams
Operations Teams
Research Teams
Legal Teams
Product Trust Teams
Crisis Investigations Teams
"Recovering Academics" Have a Leg Up: The panelists agree that individuals transitioning from academia (often referred to as "alt-ac" or "post-ac") often possess valuable experience, particularly in research and critical thinking, that is highly relevant to Trust and Safety.
While the discussion doesn't provide specific numerical statistics on the racial or demographic makeup of Trust and Safety professionals, it consistently emphasizes the value of diverse backgrounds and skills, suggesting an inclusive approach to hiring within the field. The overall sentiment is that the Trust and Safety field is growing and actively seeking talented individuals from varied academic and professional paths.
