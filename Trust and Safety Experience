Relevant Backgrounds and Professional Experience
While direct experience isn't a prerequisite, certain professional backgrounds often provide highly relevant transferable skills for trust and safety roles. These include:
Legal or Law Enforcement: Experience with legal frameworks, investigations, evidence analysis, and understanding severe incidents.
Community Management and Social Media Roles: Understanding online communities, content dynamics, user behavior, and platform guidelines.
Tech Roles: Familiarity with technology, platforms, and potentially data-driven environments.
Project Managers, Incident Managers, and Vendor Managers: Skills in organization, problem-solving, process management, and working with external partners.
Finance/Banking: Experience with fraud detection, risk assessment, and compliance can be valuable.
Even backgrounds like education, journalism, or psychology can offer strong analytical, communication, and critical thinking skills that are highly applicable to trust and safety work.

Historically Available Jobs
Historically, some of the more common and foundational roles in trust and safety include:
Trust and Safety Specialist/Investigator (Content Moderator): These are core operational roles that involve assessing content against policies, investigating individual incidents, and applying terms of service. Many people, including senior leaders in the field, started in these roles as a generalist entry point.
Law Enforcement Operations/Response: Teams that handle very severe or time-sensitive cases, report to authorities, and deal with legal processes like subpoenas. Experience in law enforcement or roles requiring meticulous process adherence is highly relevant here.
Policy Roles (Content Policy/Platform Policy): These involve writing, researching, and executing the rules and guidelines (e.g., terms of service, community guidelines). While some policy roles are very specific, the fundamental need for clear, enforceable rules has always been present.

Newer and Evolving Roles
As the field matures and faces more complex challenges, new and more specialized roles are emerging:
Specialized Content Moderators/Analysts: Instead of general content moderation, roles now specialize in areas like misinformation, hateful conduct, harassment, child safety, or specific regional/market nuances. These roles require deep expertise in a particular policy area or type of harm.
Disinformation Analysts: With the rise of complex influence operations, roles focused specifically on analyzing and combating disinformation are becoming more common.
Data Science/Analysts (Specialized): While data analysis has always been important, there's an increasing need for data scientists and analysts who can specifically build forecasts for trust and safety operations, analyze policy effectiveness, understand issue flows, and manage budgets specific to safety initiatives.
Tooling Engineers: These engineers build the internal tools and services that trust and safety teams use. Historically, tooling wasn't seen as "glamorous," but it's now recognized as crucial for efficient and effective safety operations, offering a high degree of influence and impact.
Program/Project Managers (Specialized): While project management is a broad field, there's an increasing demand for program and project managers who understand the unique complexities of trust and safety operations, including incident management, vendor management, and specific safety program oversight.
Machine Learning/AI Engineers (Trust and Safety Focused): As platforms increasingly rely on ML/AI for content detection and enforcement, engineers specializing in developing and refining these systems for trust and safety purposes are in high demand.
