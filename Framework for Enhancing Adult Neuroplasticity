Framework for Enhancing Adult Neuroplasticity
Huberman consolidates the elements for accelerating adult neuroplasticity into four key components:

Arrive with the Correct Autonomic Arousal: Manage limbic friction to achieve a clear, calm, and focused state.
Make Errors: Actively engage in the learning process by embracing and learning from mistakes.
Engage the Vestibular System with Novelty: Introduce new, slightly unstable relationships to gravity through movement to trigger neurochemical release.
Set a High Contingency: Have an important, subjective reason or reward attached to the learning outcome to accelerate the process.
He emphasizes that understanding the mechanisms behind these principles is crucial, as it provides flexibility to adapt protocols to individual circumstances, rather than rigidly adhering to a single practice.
